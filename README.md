# Amazons

A C backend library and frontend command line program for the [Game of the Amazons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons). Inspired by [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSOSeRZVNg).

The Game of the Amazons is a board game in a similar family as go and chess. Each player controls a customizable number of Amazons that can move on a board of arbitrary size like queens in chess. After moving, the Amazons must shoot an arrow. The arrows also move like queens in chess. Amazons cannot move to or over a square that is occupied by an arrow or another Amazon belonging to either player. The first player unable to make a move loses. Equivalently, the last player able to make a legal move wins.

This implementation allows the board to be of any size and each player may play with an arbitrary number of Amazons in any starting position. The standard configuration is also available in the frontend. It involves a 10x10 board with each player controlling 4 Amazons in the following configuration:

```
...W..W...
..........

W........W

B........B

...B..B...
```
